Deadliest Catcher	Title	Other			Earn the "Crab Boat Crew" bonus during an ocean fishing voyage on the Indigo route. As a party, catch 250 or more crabs (30% bonus).		FALSE					
Big Shell	Mount	Other			Purchased for 8400 Skybuilders' Scrips from Enie.		FALSE				Summon forth your big shell mount, which is ironically rather small. Still quite big for a crab, though. Raised by a Qiqirn culinary connoisseur, this carefree crustacean formed a bond of friendship with its keeper, and in so doing, escaped the cookpot. Though it may not be the most obvious choice for a mount, its smooth, round shell makes it one of the more comfortable.	
Orthos Craklaw	Mount	Other			Gold-tinged Sack (Eureka Orthos)		FALSE				Summon forth your Orthos craklaw. May or may not have participated in famous battles which actually took place in history. Discovered in Eureka Orthos, this specimen of craklaw was imbued with magic in a bid to further harden its carapace. Though that experiment ended in failure, by way of a peculiar side effect, it has attained the power of flight. 	
Crabe de la Crabe	Minion	Other			Waterside Exploration XXVI, XXVII, XXVIII		FALSE				Summon your crabe de la crabe minion. If it were any crabbier, it would...probably still be a crab. Native to Thavnair, this tree-dwelling crab became known to foreign scholars when an Arkasodara clan pointed them out to a visiting crew. So exemplarily crab-like were its features, it was promptly identified as such and given a name to match.	Island Sanctuary: <snip> <snap>
Smallshell	Minion	Other			It's Not Lupus (Gold Medal rating required) Eastern La Noscea, south of Costa del Sol (x31,y34)		FALSE				Summon your smallshell minion. The mere sight of this wee wavekin may cause severe psychological trauma to those who spent years of their lives on faraway shores culling his relatives. As is implied by its name, the smallshell's shell is small. What is not widely known is that unlike normal crabs whose shells grow thicker and, hence, larger as the crabs age, smallshell carapaces actually reduce in size due to erosion over the wavekin's lifespan, until nothing is left but legs.

Once the sporelings begin to sprout, the crab will use its claws to slice off the mushrooms and eat them.	This amazing crab will rub its shell against funguars to collect spores, which it will then grow on its back. The fungi are said to induce visions, including those of a famous theologian who, after consuming one, claimed that he had a vision showing him the answer to the meaning of life─that answer being the number 41.

Jacques the Snipper	Fish	La Noscea	2.2	ARR	Lower La Noscea: Moraby Drydocks	X:26.4 Y:34.5	FALSE	latitude: 183 and longitude: 617.9		jacquesthesnipper.png	A king among pebble crabs, and lord of the waters of the Moraby Drydocks.	Jacques the Snipper is the name given to this fiendish pebble crab, who has a penchant for cutting mooring lines and setting fishing vessels adrift. For long years it has been the bane of shipwrights and anglers alike.

In darkness, the helmet dreams, as from the waves of destruction a new beginning rises. Come, brave fishers, heed the helmet's call. Gather once more and witness a crab respawned.
The Assassin	Fish	The Black Shroud	2.3	ARR	East Shroud: Sanctum of the Twelve	X:17.9 Y:17.0	FALSE	latitude: 610 and longitude: 404.6		theassasin.png	A king among river crabs, and lord of the waters of the Sanctum of the Twelve.	Though believed to be a river crab─a species known to feed on carrion and algae─this uniquely large specimen has been spotted attacking and devouring living fish, leading to speculation on the eventual evolutionary track of its brethren.
The Terpsichorean	Fish	La Noscea	2.3	ARR	Eastern La Noscea: Raincatcher Gully	X:20.5 Y:30.5	FALSE	latitude: 283.5 and longitude: 476.2		theterpsichorean.png	A king among mitten crabs. When given the opportunity, he will, quite literally, cut a rug. 	When selecting a mate, female mitten crabs will look no further than a male's claws. To make their mittens appear larger than they actually are, some males will put on a dance in which they wave their arms back and forth─a technique that works surprisingly well, as can be attested by all the baby crabs in Raincatcher Gully bearing the Terpsichorean's features.
Magicked Mushroom	Fish	The Black Shroud	2.4	ARR	East Shroud: Sylphlands	X:26.0 Y:20.9	FALSE	latitude: 517 and longitude: 610.3		magickedmushrooms.png	A king among mushroom crabs.	With over a thousand different varieties of funguar documented in Eorzea alone, the probability that sooner or later an unknowing mushroom crab will collect the spores of a particularly nasty species is higher than one might think. And, that which does not kill the crab can only make him more magical.
Coerthan Crab	Fish	Coerthas	3.0	HW	Coerthas Western Highlands: Riversmeet; Clearpool	X:32.8 Y:27.6; X:36.8 Y:6.0	FALSE	latitude: 377.5 and longitude: 737.4; latitude: 873 and longitude: 823.4		coerthancrab.png	A freshwater crustacean only found in the coldest of lakes.	Once only found in the glacial lakes that pepper Abalathia's Spine, the everlasting winter currently overtaking Coerthas has drawn the crustaceans down from the mountains and into the highlands where they have fewer natural enemies.

Writings extracted from recently discovered tomestones state that this particular breed of helmet crab was biologically altered by Allagans to produce an impenetrable shell that could be harvested for armor production.
Lava Crab	Fish	Dravania	3.0	HW	The Dravanian Forelands: Mourn; Anyx Old	X:13.1 Y:13.5; X:19.6 Y:10.9	FALSE	latitude: 714.75 and longitude: 280.9; latitude: 774 and longitude: 426.5		lelecrab.png	This hard-shelled crustacean is one of few creatures on Eorzea which withstand the heat of molten lava.	Only recently discovered, natural scholars are still at a loss as to how any creature, this crab included, can survive in scalding liquid rock. Tests conducted by the Thaumaturges' Guild have found that the hard carapace can withstand heat up to that generated by Fire IV.
Augmented High Allagan Helmet	Fish	Abalathia's Spine	3.3	HW	Azys Lla: Alpha Quadrant	X:17.0 Y:11.9	FALSE	latitude: 739.5 and longitude: 370.4		augmentedhighallaganhelmet.png	A king among high Allagan helmets, and lord of the waters of the Alpha Quadrant.	With a shell even harder than a typical Allagan helmet, this biological aberration feeds by releasing a highly corrosive substance onto rocks, dissolving them into a foul solution which is then slurped back up using the wavekin's straw-like tongue.
Broken Crab	Fish	Gyr Abania	4.0	SB	Rhalgr's Reach: Upper Mirage Creek	X:11.0 Y:14.0	FALSE	latitude: 360 and longitude: 487.9		brokencrab.png	A wildly misnamed freshwater crab with a highly durable carapace.	Possessed of a shell no living creature could crack, the crab's hubris grew so great as to warrant the notice of Rhalgr, who by his very hand split its shell asunder for eternity, or so it is said.
Carpenter Crab	Fish	Gyr Abania	4.0	SB	The Lochs: Loch Seld Southeastern Lakebed; Loch Seld Southwestern Lakebed	X:24.7 Y:28.1	TRUE	latitude: 340.5 and longitude: 571.5; latitude: 316 and longitude: 477.4		carpentercrab.png	A carpenter crab's claws are powerful enough to cut through solid wood. Whether or not a carpenter crab has ever constructed something from that wood remains unconfirmed.	An expert at meticulously crafting dwellings out of salt licks, this architectural crustacean's schematic weakness lies in its failure to build in a backdoor, allowing itself to be cornered by all too many guileful fishermen.
Gauntlet Crab	Fish	Othard	4.0	SB	Yanxia: The One River Southwestern Riverbeds	X:15.3 Y:37.7	TRUE	 latitude: 102.5 and longitude: 338.5		gauntletcrab.png	These giant crabs hide themselves amongst the plants that grow on a river's bed, the moss growing on their claws used as camouflage.	This crab runs the migratory gauntlet of the river, starting out at the basin, then venturing upstream to freshwater in midlife before ultimately returning out to sea to bear its young.
Grymm Crab	Fish	Gyr Abania	4.0	SB	The Peaks: Grymm & Enid	X:6.3 Y:15.2	FALSE	latitude: 657.5 and longitude: 123.9		grymmcrab.png	A succulent freshwater crab remarkably found only in the Peaks lake of Grymm.	A tragic crab named for a man who nearly perished of thirst while fleeing the floods of the Sixth Umbral Calamity, only to eventually drown guzzling the first fresh water he stumbled upon.
Kamina Crab	Fish	Othard	4.0	SB	Yanxia: Imperial Hypersonic Assault Craft L-XXIII	X:34.9 Y:36.5	TRUE	latitude: 117 and longitude: 815.5		kaminacrab.png	While abundant in the sea, hermit crabs are quite rare in fresh water, possibly due to the lack of available homes. The kamina crab is one example.	This hermit crab spins its way through several spiral shells over the course of its curmudgeonly life, gradually grabbing larger domiciles as it chases pesky neighbors away from its property.
Mercenary Crab	Fish	Gyr Abania	4.0	SB	The Lochs: Loch Seld Central Lakebed	X:24.7 Y:28.1	TRUE	latitude: 422.5 and longitude: 541.5		mercenarycrab.png	This heavily armored crab is one of few species adapted to the hypersalinated waters of Loch Seld.	This freelance, armed with a sturdy helm and pair of pincers, was once consulted for tactical strategy, as oracles invoked plastromancy to divine routes to victory from the lines beneath its carapace.
Nirvana Crab	Fish	Gyr Abania	4.0	SB	The Fringes: The Comet's Tail	X:14.0 Y:31.1	FALSE	latitude: 262.75 and longitude: 314.5		nirvanacrab.png	The backs of these freshwater crabs are adorned with colorful colonies of water-resistant fungus.	It is said an underachieving monk achieved enlightenment in a single night. On inspecting his bedchambers, the assembled throng of disciples received the wordless sermon of this crab holding up a white mushroom.
Snow Crab	Fish	Othard	4.0	SB	The Ruby Sea: The Adventure	X:16.3 Y:24.8	TRUE	latitude: 429 and longitude: 400.5		snowcrab.png	Snow crabs live in deep waters, scurrying hither and thither across the ocean floor in search of carrion.	Spontaneous though it may be, occasionally a species will simply be named after the first thing its finder spies in the vicinity, as in the case of this cold-climate crustacean.
Spider Crab	Fish	Othard	4.0	SB	The Ruby Sea: Ruby Price Depths	X.32.6 Y:29.7	TRUE	latitude: 314 and longitude: 756.5		spidercrab.png	The spider crab's spindly legs carry the deep-sea crustacean hundreds of malms across their migratory routes.	Based on history, we know this massive crab can extend its major claws to span the width of two adult Hyurs set shoulder to shoulder.
Yu-no-hana Crab	Fish	Othard	4.0	SB	Yanxia: The Dragon's Struggle	X:11.0 Y:11.0	TRUE	latitude: 773.25 and longitude: 252.4		yunohanacrab.png	Hingan folklore has that all hot springs were once dug from the ground by these hardy crustaceans.	Borrowing its name from the Hingan word for the “flowers” of sintered sediment found in hot springs, this crab has the curious ability to warm the waters around itself, not unlike younglings in a pool
Khaal Crab	Fish	Othard	4.3	SB	The Azim Steppe: Hak Khaal	X:29.1 Y:20.3	FALSE	latitude: 522 and longitude: 677.1		khaalcrab.png	A crustacean that thrives in the rivers of the Azim Steppe.

A surfeit of aether in its home waters has blanched this crab of all color. However, it takes on a bright, scarlet hue when blanched in boiling water. This sudden and surprising transformation is enough to make one blanch.
Ankle Snipper	Fish	Norvrandt	5.0	SHB	The Rak'tika Greatwood: North Lake Tusi Mek'ta	X:5.3 Y:25.7	TRUE	latitude: 395.5 and longitude: 102.9		anklesnipper.png	Freshwater crabs of this species native to the Rak'tika Greatwood are not known for their discrimination in what they clamp with their claws when they are surprised, threatened, or merely in a bad mood.	Native to the waterways of the Rak'tika Greatwood, this small, stone-colored crab will hide itself among the riverbed rubble, attacking the ankles of any passing animals with its viselike pincers.
Clawbow	Fish	Norvrandt	5.0	SHB	The Rak'tika Greatwood: Lake Tusi Mek'ta; The Red Chalice; The Lozatl; South Mjrl's Regret; Woven Oath; Mjrl's Tears	X:7.4 Y:28.7; X:9.9 Y:20.9; X:16.1 Y:21.6; X:24.0 Y:31.7; X:8.0 Y:16.2; X:26.0 Y:36.9	FALSE	latitude: 317 and longitude: 152.9; latitude: 510.5 and longitude: 213.9; latitude: 494 and longitude: 370.1; latitude: 250 and longitude: 566.4; latitude: 627.25 and longitude: 167.9; latitude: 130.5 and longitude: 614.5		clawbow.png	This type of crab is native to the Rak'tika Greatwood, and was doubtless named by the Viis.	A small crustacean named for its oversized left pincer, which lends it the appearance of an archer holding a greatbow. As one might expect, the crab is unable to shoot arrows from its arms—only dirty looks from its beady eyes.
Garik Crab	Fish	Norvrandt	5.0	SHB	Amh Araeng: The Hills of Amber	X:15.5 Y:14.9	FALSE	latitude: 653 and longitude: 359.5		garikcrab.png	One of a species of crabs native to western Amh Araeng.	With its burly body and claws covered in bristly hairs that resemble the work mitts worn by miners, this crustacean became something of a symbol of pride to the pitmen of Garik, before they all moved away.
Gourmand Crab	Fish	Norvrandt	5.0	SHB	The Rak'tika Greatwood: North Lake Tusi Mek'ta; Deep Lake Tusi Mek'ta	X:5.3 Y:25.7; X:5.7 Y:29.1	TRUE	latitude: 395.5 and longitude: 102.9; latitude: 312 and longitude: 111.9		gourmandcrab.png	Though this crab is omnivorous in the sense that it will eat both flesh and plant matter, this should not be taken to mean that it does not have a discerning palate.	A close cousin of the robber crab that lives alongside it, the gourmand crab is a pickier eater than its omnivorous ally, feeding only on the blue berries that lend its shell its distinctive hue.
Hermit Crab	Fish	Norvrandt	5.0	SHB	The Rak'tika Greatwood: The Covered Halls of Dwatl	X:9.5 Y:30.0	TRUE	latitude: 292 and longitude: 208.5		hermitcrab.png	This species of crab is known for its cowardice and incredibly specific shell preferences.	Like a religious recluse, it lives alone in its seashell home. For reasons unknown, it refuses to take up residence in a shell of two or fewer colors, or of four or more. Only a shell striped thrice will suffice.
Paradise Crab	Fish	Norvrandt	5.0	SHB	Il Mheg: Thysm Lran; East Longmirror Lake	X:30.2 Y:29.3; 30.0 Y.24.7	FALSE	latitude: 315 and longitude: 714.5; latitude: 415 and longitude: 708.5		paradisecrab.png	The shell of this unusual crab is covered with mushrooms of such bright and appealing colors that they almost seem to be screaming, “Eat me!”	A wanderer who once strayed into a land of eternal springtime tells of how he met with a man who lived in a mushroom house who grew mushrooms to feed his family, who were also made of mushrooms. The moral of the story is─don't eat fungus from a crab's back.
Robber Crab	Fish	Norvrandt	5.0	SHB	The Rak'tika Greatwood: Lake Tusi Mek'ta; South Mjrl's Regret	X:7.4 Y:28.7; X:20.0 Y:31.7	FALSE	latitude: 317 and longitude: 152.9; latitude: 250 and longitude: 566.4		robbercrab.png	A member of an omnivorous and aggressive species of hermit crab.	According to popular belief, this crab climbs trees and steals fruit from their branches, but this is naught but a tall tale. In truth, it is an omnivorous scavenger, feeding on fallen fruit and carrion alike.
Shadow Crab	Fish	Norvrandt	5.0	SHB	Amh Araeng: The River of Sand; The Nabaath Severance	X:32.0 Y:12.8; X:31.0 Y:31.7	FALSE	latitude: 705.5 and longitude: 755.0; latitude: 246 and longitude: 733.0		shadowcrab.png	This dark grey crab dwells in eastern Amh Araeng─or did until someone poached it.	These creatures normally lurk beneath the surface of the sand with only their eyes protruding, but when prey approach they burst forth, bludgeoning their victims with bulky claws before slinking back to the shadows.
Yeti Crab	Fish	Norvrandt	5.0	SHB	The Tempest: West Caliban Gap	X:6.3 Y:13.5	FALSE	latitude: 684 and longitude: 121.4		yeticrab.png	This pale deep-sea crustacean is entirely covered in fine white cilia.	A crustacean covered in thick, white fur like that of the yetis who haunt the snowfields of Coerthas. Its eyestalks are underdeveloped compared to other crabs—instead of relying on eyesight, it navigates its surroundings by detecting the aether in the water with its hairs.
Kholusian King Crab	Fish	Norvrandt	5.1	SHB	Kholusia: The Western Kholusian Coast	X:8.5 Y:35.0	FALSE	latitude: 153.5 and longitude: 173.5		KholusianKingCrab.png	Though few can deny its exquisite taste when cooked, some may feel that this species is rather lacking in king-like qualities.	Until recent years, it was believed that these ungainly wavekin were swallowed by the Flood of Light, unable to escape due to the unbelievably slow pace at which they move. Whether they survived thanks to their natural resilience or through sheer luck remains a mystery, though many were glad to see these edible crustaceans return in great numbers to the waters of Kholusia.
The Unforgiven	Fish	Norvrandt	5.1	SHB	Lakeland: The Source	X:12.7 Y:29.6	FALSE	latitude: 297 and longitude: 295.97		theunforgiven.png	A king among albino rock crabs, and lord of the waters of the great lake known as the Source.	Its pure white coloration has led many to speculate that it is in fact a sin eater, which while far from the truth, provides a convenient excuse for fishers who return empty-handed after attempting to snare this formidable creature.
Bartholomew the Chopper	Fish	Other	5.2	SHB	The Northern Strait of Merlthor		FALSE	Ocean Fishing		bartholomewthechopper.png	Suspected by some to be the reincarnation of an unhinged murderer, although it is also known to have a more amiable side. Well, about as amiable as one can expect from a wavekin that revels in killing.	Clad in thick chitin plates and armed with razor-sharp pincers, this vicious wavekin makes sport of many weaker ocean-dwellers, seemingly murdering them for its own amusement. It is rumored that it also has a more genial side, if one is prepared to overlook the fact it is practically an aquatic serial killer.
Charlatan Survivor	Fish	Other	5.2	SHB	The Southern Strait of Merlthor		FALSE	Ocean Fishing		charlatansurvivor.png	At first glance, the charlatan survivor may appear to be a well-armored crustacean, but the outer shell is merely a purloined disguise concealing a much smaller creature beneath. Luckily, predatory wavekin are quite easily deceived and often choose to leave it alone in order to pursue less chitinous prey.	Pretender to the throne, a mere shadow of the light it apes, dissembler of the highest order, and soulless charlatan─this wavekin has been called all that and more besides. However, the vitriol fails to penetrate the helmet's shell, and so the impostor sleeps, content inside its ill-begotten plunder.
Net Crawler	Fish	Other	5.2	SHB	The Northern Strait of Merlthor		FALSE	Ocean Fishing		newcrawler.png	Unlike most crabs, the main source of edible meat is found in the legs. The torso is often discarded as it mostly consists of hard gristle and unappetizing...matter.	The first fishers that spied this wavekin in their nets were astounded by its massive size, but their enthusiasm was soon dampened when they discovered that it had little in the way of edible meat. Although scant, its flavor was appetizing, and culinarians that know how to get the most out of each crab have become prized commodities in Limsa Lominsa.
Blue Crab	Fish	Norvrandt	5.3	SHB	Kholusia: The Western Kholusian Coast	X:8.5 Y:35.0	FALSE	latitude: 153.5 and longitude: 173.5		bluecrab.png	A small crab that would be otherwise unremarkable if not for its vibrant blue shell.	This wavekin's blue carapace turns a pale rose hue when heat is applied to it; a common sight in the taverns of Wright, where the cast-off shells of growing crabs are fried whole and served with a draught of ale. One crab's trash is a hungry man's pleasure.
Bloodpolish Crab	Fish	Other	5.4	SHB	The Bloodbrine Sea		FALSE	Ocean Fishing		bloodpolishcrab.png	These wavekin cover their claws in blood to make themselves presentable to potential mates. Though this may seem odd, perhaps it is best not to attempt to understand the inner workings of a crab's mind.	Legend has it that these were once simple blue crabs, which, upon beholding the painted nails of well-groomed merfolk, were consumed with irrational envy. According to their tiny crab brains, a similar effect could be achieved by keeping their claws drenched in blood.
Exterminator	Fish	Other	5.4	SHB	The Bloodbrine Sea		FALSE	Ocean Fishing		exterminator.png	Experienced fishers will make sure this insatiable wavekin is well and truly dead before putting it anywhere near their other catches, otherwise it will devour them in a matter of moments.	Armed with heavy pincers and a voracious appetite, this crab is rightly feared by the other denizens of the spectral current for its relentless enthusiasm in dismembering and devouring still-living prey.
Oracular Crab	Fish	Other	5.4	SHB	The Bloodbrine Sea		FALSE	Ocean Fishing		oracularcrab.png	While bloodpolish crabs are certainly frightening, this larger and more violent relative is nothing less than a nightmare come to life.	A particularly large variant of the bloodpolish crab said to appear with the spectral current. Its habit of cramming the shredded pieces of prey into a chosen hollow has been interpreted by some as a ritual offering to the all-seeing spirits of the deep.
Thaliak Crab	Fish	Other	5.4	SHB	The Bloodbrine Sea		FALSE	Ocean Fishing		thaliakcrab.png	Something of an anomaly among crabs as it spends its life moving back and forth between salt- and freshwater. Its flavor differs according to where it is caught.	Although technically a type of river crab, this crustacean spends its larval stage in the sea. Once grown, it crawls up to dwell in the waters of the Thaliak, only to return to the ocean again and again in order to spawn.
Titanshell Crab	Fish	Other	5.4	SHB	The Cieldalaes		FALSE	Ocean Fishing		titanshellcrab.png	Those wishing to sample the succulent meat inside must first contend with its near-impenetrable shell. Or alternatively, have the fishmonger do that part for them beforehand.	This crab is prized for the cloud-soft whiteness and delicacy of its meat. Unscrupulous fishmongers are known to boil cheaper specimens to simulate the crimson hue of its carapace, but a canny customer always checks the thickness of the shell.
Tortoiseshell Crab	Fish	Other	5.4	SHB	The Cieldalaes		FALSE	Ocean Fishing		tortoiseshellcrab.png	Somewhere out there is bound to be a crabshell tortoise.	The carapace of this crab is unusually thick and durable, as if it had, indeed, traded shells with an amenable, hard-backed reptile. Such natural defenses, however, avail it little against a sudden influx of crab boats, seeking to capitalize on the growing demand for this Cieldalaes delicacy.
Grade 4 Skybuilders' Cyan Crab	Fish	Other	5.4	SHB	The Diadem: Diadem Grotto	X:11.1 Y:35.7	FALSE	latitude: 150 and longitude: 241.8		Grade4SkybuildersCyanCrab.png	It is common for creatures to be named for their color, but since “blue crab” was already taken, this species was granted somewhat more fanciful nomenclature.	
Grade 4 Skybuilders' Goldsmith Crab	Fish	Other	5.4	SHB	The Diadem: Southern Diadem Lake	X:11.4 Y:30.4	FALSE	latitude: 283.5 and longitude: 248.3		Grade4SkybuildersGoldsmithCrab.png	Though it may be named for the deftness with which it uses its claws as tools to methodically dismantle its prey, perhaps “butcher crab” would be a more fitting appellation.	
Maru Crab	Fish	Norvrandt	5.5	SHB	The Tempest: West Caliban Gap	X:6.2 Y:13.5	FALSE	latitude: 684 and longitude: 121.4		marucrab.png	A king among yeti crabs, and lord of the waters of west Caliban Gap.	This bulky ocean crustacean bears the name of a water deity, the tales of which are passed down in the local lore of the Tempest. Highly sensitive to aetheric disturbances, it is often able to gather its fellows and flee before predators or other dangers arrive.
Gwl Crab	Fish	Ilsabard	6.0	EW	Thavnair: Yedlihmad	X:25.5 Y:36.3	FALSE	latitude: 132 and longitude: 599.5		gwlcrab.png	A cast of these crustaceans resembles an underwater rose.	This crab's carapace is so arrestingly cerise, it is no surprise it was bestowed the name of “rose.” Indeed, when multiple gather, they resemble a flower in full bloom. Alas, these roses of the sea, like their floral counterparts, have a thorn─deadly toxins.
Ruby-spotted Crab	Fish	Othard	6.0	EW	The Ruby Sea: Northern Onokoro; Northwestern Onokoro	X:28.3 Y:3.6;  X:23.5 Y:3.5	TRUE	latitude: 931.5 and longitude: 665.9; latitude: 941 and longitude: 546.9		rubyspottedcrab.png	Though this crab advertises its toxicity with its bright and spotted carapace, some people just never learn. 	As its charmingly rubescent hue and mottled carapace signal a body replete with toxins, this wavekin is better admired than consumed. Fishermen of the Ruby Sea avail themselves of its poison's paralytic properties to more easily catch schools in a single swoop.
Skipping Stone	Fish	Othard	6.0	EW	The Ruby Sea: Northeastern Bekko	X:37.3 Y:12.3	TRUE	latitude: 710.5 and longitude: 848.6		skippingstone.png	A diminutive wavekin living in the shallows northeast of Bekko.	These small crabs mimic pebbles scattered around boulders on the sea floor. While the shell is thick and there is little edible flesh, it is an indispensable part of a pirate's diet thanks to its suitability for stock.
Spiny King Crab	Fish	Ilsabard	6.0	EW	Thavnair: Southern Akyaali	X:14.8 Y:36.9	TRUE	latitude: 125 and longitude: 346.97		spinykingcrab.png	A crustacean covered head to pincers in painful spines.	A crustaceous wavekin whose body is covered in razor-sharp spines to fend off potential predators, straightforwardly named by a visiting merchant from Kugane who once had the misfortune of stepping upon one.
Lale Crab	Fish	Ilsabard	6.2	EW	Thavnair: Yedlihmad	X:25.5 Y:36.3	FALSE	latitude: 132 and longitude: 599.5		lavacrab.png	A king among gwl crabs, and lord of the shores of Yedlihmad.	Among the rosaceous gwl crabs clustered along Thavnair's shores may be found brighter and more keenly shaped specimens─distinctive blooms all their own. So elegant are their wine-colored carapaces and delicate steps that any noblewoman of Radz-at-Han treasures the gift of a lale crab above that of its namesake tulip, integrity of her suitors' digits be damned.
Hells' Claw	Fish	Other	6.4	EW	The Ruby Sea		FALSE	Ocean Fishing		hellsclaw.png	Protected by a thick layer of volcanic rock, this crustacean swims through the depths of the Ruby Sea to keep the flesh inside its shell from cooking.	This formidable king of the Crab Pots dons an armored shell of volcanic rock to protect itself against would-be predators. While this defense mechanism has proven successful, the sweltering heat of its once-molten carapace would cook the crustacean from the inside out had it not made a habit of launching itself into the cool depths of the Ruby Sea.
Iq Rrax Crab	Fish	Yok Tural	7.0	DT	Yak T'el: Iq Rrax Tsoly Depths	X:31.5 Y:6.9	TRUE	latitude: 852 and longitude: 745.5		iqrraxcrab.png	The claws of this freshwater crustacean glisten blood red. This is likely a side effect of its overwhelmingly sanguineous diet.	Roughly translated, “Iq Rrax” means “fresh blood”─a fitting name for a crustacean that consumes exactly that. Capable of filling its claws with the blood of its prey, it will draw on these grisly reserves during times of scarcity.
Plattershell	Fish	Yok Tural	7.0	DT	Kozama'uka: Waters Hanu	X:23.0 Y:12.9	FALSE	latitude: 696 and longitude: 539.0		plattershell.png	Beneath this mottled crustacean's shell lies a hearty helping of delicious meat.	This prolific crustacean is a popular food source for many living in Yok Tural, and with good reason. For a crab, it is impressively large and meaty─more than fit for a feast.
Turali Land Crab	Fish	Yok Tural	7.0	DT	Yak T'el: Xd'aa Talat Tsoly	X:5.3 Y:7.7	TRUE	latitude: 831 and longitude: 112.45		turalilandcrab.png	These brilliant blue crabs make for a filling feast when cooked.	This crab's carapace is almost indistinguishable from the deep blue waters of the caldera lakes it calls home, lending it an advantage when hunting prey and avoiding predators. Turning bright red when boiled, its shell is soft, tender, and very much edible.
Yak T'el Crab	Fish	Yok Tural	7.0	DT	Yak T'el: Xty'iinbek Tsoly	X:37.0 Y:26.0	FALSE	latitude: 387.5 and longitude: 873.1		yaktelcrab.png	A blue-shelled crab that inhabits the deep, dark waters of Xty'iinbek Tsoly. 	Xbr'aal folklore describes this crab as a messenger of the underworld. The Mamool Ja, on the other hand, consider it a herald of the heavens above.
Cazuela Crab	Fish	Yok Tural	7.1	DT	Kozama'uka: Waters Hanu 	X:23.0 Y:12.9	FALSE	latitude: 696 and longitude: 539.0		cazuelacrab.png	A king among plattershells, and lord of waters Hanu.	Considered a delicacy by the Hanuhanu, the preferred method of preparing this weighty crustacean is to simply place it atop a boiling cookpot and steam the crab, carapace and all.
